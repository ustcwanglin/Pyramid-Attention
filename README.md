Code for "Spatial-Temporal Pyramid Attention Network for Action Recognition" 

We propose a new pyramid module to take full use of inherent multi-scale 
information of CNNs. To capture more comprehensive long-range temporal 
structure, we also propose a new temporal pyramid module in which frame-level 
features are reused by various pooling approaches to get different 
time-grained features of snippets efficiently.
